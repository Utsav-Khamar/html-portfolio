<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>"Jack of many trades master of none." - If I had to describe myself in one line, this would be it!</p>

<p>By education and by heart, I'm an engineer. By profession, currently I'm a tutor. There are many things which fascinate me and my nature is such that I like to know things. So, I sometimes have to make priority as to what to do first, and I've figured out that programming is my calling. Apart from this, some of the topics which are interesting to me are: maths, english, sanskrit, music, meditation, philosophy and history.(that doesn't necessarily mean that I know much about it, but I try!)</p>

<p>I have completed my Bachelor's in Computer engineering from Gujarat Technological University in 2022. After that, I have been working as an IELTS tutor at one institute. Currently, I'm getting back to my roots, which is computer science. I'll post more once there's any Update. Till then, Peace!</p>
